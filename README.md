## ANALYSIS OF TITANATE CRISTALLINE STRUCTURE USING VESTA
VESTA is a powerful software tool used for visualizing and analyzing crystal structures. It offers a user-friendly interface for exploring the atomic arrangements within a crystal lattice. Here's a brief description and presentation of how to analyze a crystalline structure using VESTA:

1. **Importing Crystal Structure:** VESTA supports various file formats for crystal structure data, such as CIF, POSCAR, and others. You can import your crystal structure file into VESTA by selecting "File" -> "Open" and choosing the appropriate file format.

2. **3D Visualization:** Once the crystal structure is imported, VESTA displays it in a 3D graphical interface. You can rotate, zoom, and pan to examine the crystal structure from different perspectives. VESTA provides tools for adjusting the visual representation, including atom sizes, bond lengths, and symmetry elements.

3. **Crystallographic Information:** VESTA allows you to access detailed crystallographic information about the structure, such as lattice parameters, space group symmetry, atomic positions, and bond distances. This information can be displayed numerically or graphically within the interface.

4. **Symmetry Analysis:** VESTA includes tools for analyzing the symmetry properties of the crystal structure. You can visualize symmetry elements such as mirror planes, rotation axes, and inversion centers. This helps in understanding the symmetry operations that relate equivalent atomic positions within the crystal lattice.

5. **Density and Packing Analysis:** VESTA provides utilities for calculating and visualizing the density of the crystal structure, as well as the packing arrangement of atoms within unit cells. This can be useful for studying the packing efficiency and void spaces within the crystal lattice.

6. **Defects and Dislocations:** VESTA enables the identification and visualization of defects, vacancies, and dislocations within the crystal structure. You can analyze the impact of these defects on the material properties and explore their spatial distribution within the lattice.

7. **Exporting Results:** After analysis, you can export your findings from VESTA in various formats, including images, movies, and data files. This allows you to share your results with collaborators or incorporate them into presentations and publications.

In summary, VESTA is a versatile tool for analyzing crystal structures, providing a comprehensive set of features for visualization, manipulation, and interpretation of atomic arrangements within crystalline materials.
